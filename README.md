# Lineagen

A 2D genetic simulation where evolution meets communication.

## About

Lineagen explores what happens when information becomes a survival resource. Creatures evolve not just physical traits like speed and eyesight, but also the ability to communicate—sharing knowledge about food, water, and predators with nearby members of their species.

Communication isn't free. It costs energy. It's heritable. And it shapes survival.

Watch as populations develop emergent strategies across generations: Will creatures evolve to share information altruistically? Will cheaters emerge who listen but never tell? What survives when cooperation competes with self-interest?



## Status

Early development. Currently implementing core simulation systems.
